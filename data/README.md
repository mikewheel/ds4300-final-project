# Project Data

We are using the 2020-02-01 dump of current English Wikipedia Articles. The files are not stored in version control 
for space efficiency.


To set up before running:
  - Download the requisite .multistream.xml.bz2 file and corresponding index. 
  See [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download) for more info.
  - Create `./data/input` and place the Wikipedia archive and index inside
  - Create `./data/output` and leave it empty for now.
